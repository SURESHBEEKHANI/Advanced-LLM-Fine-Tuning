# Advanced LLM Fine-Tuning

A comprehensive repository for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using state-of-the-art techniques and diverse datasets. This project provides a complete framework for experimenting with various fine-tuning approaches including LoRA, QLoRA, full fine-tuning, and instruction tuning.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Fine-tuning Techniques**: Support for LoRA, QLoRA, full parameter fine-tuning, and PEFT methods
- **Diverse Model Support**: Compatible with popular models like Llama 2/3, Mistral, GPT, BERT, and more
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Automated data preprocessing and validation workflows
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU and distributed training capabilities
- **Experiment Tracking**: Integration with Weights & Biases, TensorBoard, and MLflow
- **Production Ready**: Model deployment and serving configurations
